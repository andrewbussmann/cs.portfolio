    <h3> As said on my home page, my name is Cam H, and I am 14 years old and I am in 8th grade. I moved here to Minnesota in second grade. Before I moved here, I lived in Portland, Oregon. My entire family lives there and I still go back 3 times per year. My family includes my mom, my dad, my brother Kieran, my dog Anju, and my cat Harley. I love to play with my dog in my yard whenever I can, I will include a picture of her below. I like it here in Minnesota, and I'm excited to go to high school. The picture below is one that I took of Mount Hood in Oregon. </h3>
