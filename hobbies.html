      <h2> About me: </h2>
    <h3> As said on my home page, my name is Cam Haaland, and I am 14 years old at Minnetonka Middle School East. I moved here to Minnesota in second grade. Before I moved here, I lived in Portland, Oregon. My entire family lives there and I still go back 3 times per year. My family includes my mom, my dad, my brother Kieran, my dog Anju, and my cat Harley. I like it here in Minnesota, and I'm excited to go to high school at MHS. </h3>
